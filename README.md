                                                       Hi 👋, I'm Rex

<br/>
An independent blocksec researcher with a sophisticated specialty in staking and Defi yield protocols. I tend to enjoy auditing complex logic protocols that require a lot of segregated calls and numbers more than any other type of protocol.
<br/><br/>
Across the contests I have dedicated a considerable amount of time to, the results for these staking/yield strategy contests attest to the fact of my specialty in these niche protocols. Recently, I have begun to spread my wings to accomodate the same sophistication in borrowing/lending, AMMs and Bridging protocols.
<br/>
<br/>
Across all contests I have participated in solo, I have placed in the top 5 ranking four(4) times. While working with friends (rustguy, haxatron) we placed in the top 10 ranking three(3) times as well. 
<br/>
